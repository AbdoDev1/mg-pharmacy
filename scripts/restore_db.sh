# Restore a Biozone database backup.
#
# Takes a .sql.gz file produced by backup_db.sh, wipes the current
# public schema completely, and restores the data from the backup
# instead — a "clean" restore with no conflicts against existing data.
#
# WARNING: this is destructive. Any data currently in the database
# will be permanently deleted before the restore. No undo after
# confirmation.
#
# Usage (run from the project directory, next to docker-compose.yml):
#   ./scripts/restore_db.sh backups/mgpharmacy_2026-08-05_12h.sql.gz
